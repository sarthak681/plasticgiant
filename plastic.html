        <h2>WHY PLASTIC IS A PROBLEM TO MANKIND?</h2>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li><p><b>PLASTIC</b> is pretty much present everywhere these days, as it is in almost all products and packaging across the world. This is because plastic is a very useful material, as it is durable, long lasting and helps protect and preserve goods. And most importantly it degrades slowly.</p></li>
            <li><p>The last point in the above paragraph is why plastic can also be so problematic. It nearly lasts forever without breaking down. New plastic that is added doesn’t replace old plastic; it adds to the problem further every time.</p></li>
            <li><p>Plastic also harms <b>wildlife</b>, especially <b>sea creatures</b>. Sea turtles are at a greater risk as they are known to choke on plastic bags which they mistake on jellyfish. <b>Plastic</b> buried deep in landfills can leach <b>harmful</b> chemicals that spread into groundwater. </p></li>
            <li><p><b>Plastic</b> also contributes to <b>global warming</b>. Almost all plastics are made from chemicals that come from the production of <b>planet-warming fuels</b> (gas, oil and even coal).</p></li>

        <h2>How can we tackle this?</h2>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li>
                <h3>Biodegradable plastics</h3>
                <p>Although it is still an issue, it’s harder to argue with the use of plastic for certain items that we expect to last a long time.</p>
                <p>But there are thousands of applications of plastic where this property of never degrading is simply not required. Plastic is used for a few days or weeks and is then thrown away into landfill or burnt.</p>
                <p>This has led many companies to create ‘biodegradable plastics’ as an alternative. Plastics that will break down and not be left in the environment for hundreds of years.</p>
                <p>One of my favourite examples of this is from company Mobius. They have created a biodegradable plastic to replace plastic mulch film, a commonly used plastic in horticulture used to cover crops over huge areas to prevent damage The best thing about this solution from Mobius is that they utilise an existing waste stream to make the plastics, creating a circular economy solution. This waste stream is lignin which is a by-product of the paper industry and which would usually be discarded or burnt.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>Edible water bottles</h3>
                <p>Not only do the majority of places in the developed world now have clean drinking water from taps, there are also a growing number of refill stations and water fountains in cities where re-useable bottles can be topped up.</p>
                <p>Every year in the United States alone, it is estimated that 50 billion single-use plastic water bottles are produced.</p>
                <p>There are a number of ways to tackle this problem. We must educate people to the impacts and provide easy alternatives to allow access to water in public spaces in towns and cities. We must put pressure on the big brands that are producing all the waste in the first place. And finally, we must look to innovate to find new solutions.</p>
                <p>One of these exciting solutions is the idea of an edible water bottle! As weird as it sounds start-up Skipping Rocks Labs has created a blob-like container made from sodium alginate, which is able to contain the water in a small pouch that can be ingested harmlessly.</p>
                <p>The idea was taken from a process known as specification which was actually invented way back in the 1940s.</p>
                <p>The technology has started to make appearances in the mainstream. This year it was used in the London marathon where instead of handing out plastic water bottles or cups, race volunteers instead handed out small edible capsules filled with Lucozade energy drink instead.</p>
                <p>This technology has its limitations over plastic bottles but it is uses like this where it makes practical sense and can reduce single use plastic quite substantially.</p>

                <h3>3D Printing Street Furniture</h3>
                <p>3D printing is a growing technology. It allows anyone (well anyone who owns a 3D printer) to download the plans for an item and see it printed in 3D plastic right in front of their eyes.</p>
                <p>A group of students at UC Berkley have managed to find a way to use old single use plastic materials, melt them back down and then use the to produce useful items, rather than just letting them reach landfill.</p>
                <p>This was taken to another level by the ‘New Raw Association’ who used the same process on a large scale to 3D print street furniture out of waste plastics. It takes 100kg of plastic waste to create just one of the street benches, but when we are talking about finding a solution to this waste stream, the more plastic it takes the better.</p>

                <h3>Using it as fuel</h3>
                <p>Scientists in 2016 managed to find a way to break down polyethylene-based single use plastics into an ‘alkane’. This alkane product is more commonly known as diesel fuel. Around 55% of the plastics can be used as fuel, but the rest can be used to create other products and so it is all put to use.</p>
                <p>Not all plastics are made from polyethylene so this only solves part of the problem.</p>
                <p>This solution can only be temporary however, as burning diesel fuels produces harmful greenhouse gases that are causing climate change. So, although this is solving the issues around plastic waste it isn’t tackling all the environmental issues at play. Solutions such as this must only be used as we transition towards renewable energy.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Although many of these innovations give us hope that single use plastics can be kept away from landfills and the oceans, we shouldn’t forget that we should still be trying to reduce unnecessary plastic use wherever possible.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">But the reality is that plastic pollution across the world is still a big issue that we need to solve quickly, and if innovation can help with this then we need all the help we can get.</p>
